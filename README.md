## Overview of the statistical analysis:

> The purpose of this statistical analysis is to show the summary of the temeratures from June and December in Hawaii. We can use this analysis to understand the typical weather in the hotest month (June) and the coolest month (December) and how to handle the temperature fluctuations for a store-front.

## Results:
> June
> - High Temp: 85&deg;F
> - Min Temp: 64&deg;F
> - Avg Temp: 74&deg;F

> December
> - High Temp: 83&deg;F
> - Min Temp: 56&deg;F
> - Avg Temp: 71&deg;F

## Summary:
> The biggest differnece between June and December is that December has a lower minimum temperature. The high temperature and the average temerature are similar enough to not show that large of a differnece. Some things we did not consider that could lead to further understanding would be the amount of days in a month did it rain, how many inches of rain per day for each month, wind speeds per hour per day per month, and the times of day for low tide and high tide per day per month.
